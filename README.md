# Etch-a-Sketch Project
The goal of this project (assigned by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)) was to create a browser version of a cross between an Etch-a-Sketch and a sketchpad.
Moving your mouse over blank squares on the sketchpad displays a random colour. Moving over existing colours
darkens them, with each mouseover gradually turning the colour to black. There is also an option to adjust
the pad's size to a height/width value of between 1-128.
